# Why do you have this?

I was attempting to develop a mobile app, and registered a business prior to 
creating an Apple App Store developer account.

And then ended up so 'concussed', that it's taken five (or fifteen) years for 
my brain to return to normal. 


## Is it in context now?

Yes, but I'm seeing it from the perspective of science fiction, and it's too 
patronising to continue to play along.

Your hometown sucks, and the worst part about it is the adults that would 
prefer to see everyone stay in high school their entire lives.

## What about now

broke as shit and everyone is playing a name game
